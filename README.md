My name is Carol, I'm from Brazil. I've been working as a Java Developer since 2019, and yes, I'm a tech lover!
Mostly enjoy being "javeira" (Java lover) but also very curious about tonnes of other programming languages.

Enjoying free time is something I do love too. Sports are my favorite hobbies, mainly "futvolei" and "futmesa" - if you don't know any of them, look for athletes like Nathalia Guitler or Belo.

So, that's it
ENJOY!
